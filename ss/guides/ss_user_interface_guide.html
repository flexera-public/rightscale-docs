The Self-Service UI is an intuitive interface providing access to all the functionality required by administrators, designers, and end-users. The Self-Service UI comprises four different <q>views</q> that allow you to work with the various components and aspects of the product. The Admin View, Designer View, Catalog View, and CloudApps View are described in the following sections. It is important to note that each of the views may or may not be accessible depending on User Type. In addition, User Settings are accessible by all User Types and provide a way to define user-specific items such as time zone and notification preferences.</p>

<h2 id="account-selection">Account Selection</h2>

<p>For Admins, Designers, and other users that may have access to multiple accounts, the Self-Service user interface provides controls for selecting which account is currently active. If you have access to multiple accounts and log into Self-Service you are presented with the Account Selection panel where you can choose which account you want to log into.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-account-selection-panel.png" alt="ss-account-selection-panel.png" width="402" height="236" /></p>

<p>In addition, once you are logged in, the Self-Service Account Selector is available in the upper right corner of the user interface to provide a convenient method for switching between the Self-Service enabled accounts you have access to.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-account-selector.png" alt="ss-account-selector.png" width="400" height="201" /></p>

<p><br></p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><strong>Note:</strong><p>If you are working in either RightScale Cloud Management or Optima and use the Product Selector to switch to Self-Service, you will see different behavior depending on the account you are currently working in. If your currently active account is Self-Service enabled, you will be placed into Self-Service in that same account. If, however, your currently active account is <em>not</em> Self-Service enabled, then you will be presented with the Account Selection panel from which you can choose which account you want to view in Self-Service.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="user-settings">User Settings</h2>

<p>As a Self-Service end-user you can set your local time zone and customize email notification. The User Settings page provides a variety of controls you can use to set your time zone preferences and customize the manner in which email notification is handled for your user profile. The various controls found on the User Settings page along with the steps to set your time zone and configure email notification are described below.</p>

<h3 id="user-settings-accessing-the-user-settings-page">Accessing the User Settings Page</h3>

<p>Access the User Settings page using the drop-down control located in the upper right-hand portion of the user interface.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-user-settings-menu.png" alt="User Settings Menu Image" width="155" height="73" /></p>

<h3 id="user-settings-setting-your-time-zone-preferences">Setting Your Time Zone Preferences</h3>

<h3 id="user-settings-customizing-your-email-notification-settings">Customizing Your Email Notification Settings</h3>

<p>Email Notification within Self-Sevice can be configured in two ways. First, you can set up default notification settings for any CloudApp that you launch or other users in your organization launch. Secondly, you can tailor individual notification settings for CloudApps that are already running. The following procedures outline the steps to configure your email notification settings for Self-Service CloudApps.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all Self-Service users are able to view or configure email notification settings for CloudApps that other users in their organization have launched. Your user type (admin, designer, or end-user) and the Self-Service permissions granted to you (shared or private) determine whether or not you can view and configure email notification for CloudApps other than your own.</p>

<ul>
<li>Admins and designers can always view and configure notification on CloudApps other than their own.</li>
<li>End-users must have <strong>shared</strong> permissions in order to view and configure notification on CloudApps other than their own.</li>
<li>End-users with <strong>private</strong> permissions are only allowed to view and configure notification on their own CloudApps.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="navigate-to-the-email-notifications-view">Navigate to the Email Notifications View</h4>

<ol>
<li>Open the User Settings page as described above.</li>
<li>Click the Email Notifications tab to expose the email notification configuration controls. Note that the Email Notifications view includes a top section used to specify your default email notification settings along with a second section used to configure or modify settings for running CloudApps that have already subscribed to notifications.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/img/ss-email-notification-basic.png" alt="Notification Basic Image" width="602" height="493" /></p>

<h4 id="configure-default-email-notification-settings">Configure Default Email Notification Settings</h4>

<p>To configure the default email notification settings for your CloudApps, use the <strong>CloudApps I Launch</strong> drop-down list to define how you want email notifications to be handled for the CloudApps that you yourself will launch. Here you have the following choices for receiving notification.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>All Activity</strong> - get notified of all CloudApp activities such as launches, failures, when an operation executes, or scheduled operations.</li>
<li><strong>All Activity Except Scheduled Actions</strong> - get notified of all CloudApp activity except Scheduled Actions. (default)</li>
<li><strong>Failures</strong> - only get notified when a CloudApp fails.</li>
<li><strong>Never</strong> - do not get notified regarding any CloudApp activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, use the CloudApps Launched by Others drop-down list to define how you want email notifications to be handled for the CloudApps that other users will launch. Note that only admins, designers, and end-users with shared permissions have access to this control. This control is not visible to end-users with private permissions. Here you have the following choices for receiving notification.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>All Activity</strong> - get notified of all CloudApp activities such as launches, failures, when an operation executes, or scheduled operations.</li>
<li><strong>All Activity Except Scheduled Actions</strong> - get notified of all CloudApp activity except Scheduled Actions.</li>
<li><strong>Failures</strong> - only get notified when a CloudApp fails.</li>
<li><strong>Never</strong> - do not get notified regarding any CloudApp activities. (default)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="configure-email-notification-settings-for-running-cloudapps">Configure Email Notification Settings for Running CloudApps</h4>

<p>To configure individual email notification settings for running CloudApps (launched either by you or other users in your organization), use the controls in the bottom portion of the Email Notifications view.</p>

<ol>
<li>Select one or more CloudApps in the available list. You can use the filter controls to help manage the number of displayed CloudApps. Note that the All CloudApps selection in the Show drop-down is only available to admins, designers, and end-users with <em>shared</em> permissions.</li>
<li>Use the Selected Actions drop-down to define notification settings for the selected CloudApp(s). Here you have the following choices for receiving notification.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>All Activity</strong> - get notified of all CloudApp activities such as launches, failures, when an operation executes, or scheduled operations.</li>
<li><strong>All Activity Except Scheduled Actions</strong> - get notified of all CloudApp activity except Scheduled Actions.</li>
<li><strong>Failures</strong> - only get notified when a CloudApp fails.</li>
<li><strong>Never</strong> - do not get notified regarding any CloudApp activities.</li>
<li><strong>Revert to Default</strong> - re-set email notification to the default configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Notification Settings column displays the currently defined setting for each CloudApp listed.</p>

<p>For notifications of upcoming scheduled operations on your running CloudApps. Self-Service will send notification one hour before a <q>stop</q> operation and two days before a <q>terminate</q> operation.</p>

<h4 id="overriding-default-notification-settings">Overriding Default Notification Settings</h4>

<p>You can override your default email notification configuration on individual CloudApps using the Notifications drop-down control.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-notification-override.png" alt="Notification Override Image" width="602" height="198" /></p>

<p>You can choose to be notified of all activity related to the selected CloudApp, only failures of the selected CloudApp, or you can elect to receive no notification at all.</p>

<h2 id="the-admin-view">The Admin View</h2>

<p>The Admin View provides commands and functionality you use to administer the Self-Service portal for your organization. This includes customizing the color scheme and branding for your portal as well as specifying the permissions settings. Each of these functions is described in the following sections. To access the Admin View, click on the <strong>Admin</strong> icon in the navigation pane on the left-hand side of the Self-Service user interface. Note that the Admin View is only visible to users with administrator privileges in the associated RightScale Cloud Management (CM) account.</p>

<h3 id="the-admin-view-customizing-the-user-interface">Customizing the User Interface</h3>

<p>The UI and emails for Self-Service are fully customizable from the standpoint of branding and color scheme. To access the controls for customizing your Self-Service UI and emails, click the <strong>UI Customization</strong> tab in the Admin View. The user making these changes must have &#39;admin&#39; role permissions on the account in Cloud Management.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-ui-customization.png" alt="Customization Image" width="592" height="476" /></p>

<p>The UI Customization page provides a variety of controls to help you brand your Self-Service UI and emails for your organization. A convenient Live Color Preview allows you to see what your color selections will look like in the UI before you save and apply them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary UI Color</strong> - Specify the color for the top navigation bar, primary buttons, the active left-hand navigation element, and the header in emails. Enter the hexidecimal value representing the desired color or use the color picker by clicking the right corner of the control.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Gradient Color</strong> - Apply a gradient to the primary color by entering a hexidecimal value representing the desired gradient color or use the color picker by clicking the right corner of the control. Alternately, you can use the None, Auto, and Custom buttons to specify zero gradient, an automatic 10 percent gradient, or a custom color gradient respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Table Header Color</strong> - Define the color for all table headers in the Self-Service UI. Enter the hexidecimal value representing the desired color or use the color picker by clicking the right corner of the control.</li>

<li><strong>Favicon Image URL</strong> - Enter the URL to the image that you want to use as the favicon that shows up in browser tabs and URL bars.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>HTTPS URLs are recommended to avoid &#39;insecure&#39; warnings displayed in your browser.</li>
<li>Limit the height of Primary and Secondary Logo images to 40 pixels to avoid image distortion due to re-sizing.</li>
<li>Changes are applied immediately for all users in your organization.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-admin-view-setting-permissions">Setting Permissions</h3>

<p>In the future, Self-Service will allow you to organize your users into teams and give you the power to specify granular permissions to cloud resources. In the meantime, there is a simple permission setting that will allow you to restrict access to CloudApps for end-users in your organization. The user making these changes must have &#39;admin&#39; role priveleges on the account in Cloud Management.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shared</strong> permissions option allows end-users and observers to view and access all CloudApps in the CloudApps View. The <strong>Private</strong> permissions option allows end-users and observers to only view and access the CloudApps that they have launched. Use the following steps to set the Permissions option.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Admin View, click the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select either the <strong>Shared</strong> or <strong>Private</strong> option.</li>
<li>Click Save and Apply to store your permissions setting.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The above permissions do not apply to users with &#39;designer&#39; or &#39;admin&#39; role on your account -- those users will have full visibility and control over all running CloudApps.</p>

<h3 id="the-admin-view-managing-self-service-only-end-users">Managing Self-Service Only End Users</h3>

<p>The <code>Self-Service Only End Users</code> tab allows you to view and manage users that have access to Self-Service on the given account but have no other permissions in Cloud Management or Optima. This can be leveraged to provide users with only access to the Self-Service app. In order for users to be eligible to be granted this special role, they must have <strong>no roles</strong> for the account in Cloud Management. For details on this functionality, see the <a href="/ss/getting_started/ss_user_types.html#granting-permissions">Getting Started guide to Granting Permissions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-designer-view">The Designer View</h2>

<p>The <em>Designer View</em> is where you manage CAT files and schedule options used when publishing CAT files to the catalog. See <a href="/ss/guides/ss_creating_schedules.html">Creating Schedules</a> for more information on managing schedules.</p>

<p>The main Designer View shows a list of all the CAT files that have been uploaded and compiled into CloudApps through the Self-Service UI. Each entry in the list shows the CloudApp name, the CAT file name, who uploaded the CAT, when the CAT was last uploaded, whether or not the CloudApp has been published, who it was published by, and when it was last published. </p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-designer-view.png" alt="ss-designer-view.png" width="1866" height="1047" /></p>

<p>Use the <strong>Show/Hide Columns</strong> control to specify which columns are shown in the Designer View.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-designer-columns.png" alt="Designer Columns Image" width="186" height="265" /></p>

<p>The contents of the Designer View can be filtered. Filtering choices in the <strong>Show</strong> drop-down include <strong>Published</strong>, <strong>Not Published</strong>, and <strong>Uploaded</strong> By Me.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-designer-show-filter.png" alt="Designer Show Filter Image" width="272" height="150" /></p>

<p>In addition to filtering using the <strong>Show</strong> drop-down, a text field is provided for further refinement of the filter.</p>

<p>From the Designer View a number of single and bulk actions can be initiated on one or more selected CloudApps including <strong>Launch CloudApp</strong>, <strong>View CAT File</strong>, <strong>Download CAT File</strong>, <strong>Publish to Catalog</strong>, <strong>Remove from Catalog</strong>, and <strong>Delete CAT</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-designer-view-additional-designer-view-actions">Additional Designer View Actions</h3>

<p>In addition to the actions described above, there are several other tasks that CAT designers can accomplish in the Design view. These actions are shown below and described in the following sections. Also note that most of the single actions available in the Design view are accessible by left-clicking a CAT file entry.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-additional-designer-actions.png" alt="Designer Additional Actions Image" width="470" height="456" /></p>

<h3 id="cloudapps-view-filtering-and-columns">Filtering and Columns</h3>

<p>You can configure the display of CloudApps in the CloudApps View by using the <strong>Filter</strong> control, <strong>Date Launched</strong> button, <strong>Name</strong> button, and the <strong>Show/Hide</strong> Column control. The <strong>Filter</strong> drop-down and edit field lets you specify exactly which CloudApps you want to view by providing preset filter groups and free text entry.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ss-admin-filter.png" alt="Admin Filtering Image" width="630" height="311" /></p>

<p>Using the drop-down control you can select any of the standard CloudApp states to filter on. You can also enter a text string in the edit field to provide additional filtering criteria. Within the edit field you can use special syntax to further refine your search as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>:</code> (colon) to filter on specific columns. For example, <strong>[ColumnHeader]:[value]</strong></li>
<li>Use <code>|</code> (pipe) to OR multiple values. For example, <strong>Status:Running|Provisioning</strong></li>
<li>Use <code>;</code> (semicolon) to AND multiple filters. For example, <strong>Status:Running;Linux</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the <strong>Show/Hide Columns</strong> control to further tailor the display in the CloudApps view. Click the <strong>Show/Hide Columns</strong> control to open the drop-down list.</p>

<p>Select/de-select the columns that you want to display and click the control again to close the drop-down.</p>
