## Introduction

To install at boot, an agent to interpret userdata or metadata and act on it is needed. For Linux, RightLink uses [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for this purpose. Cloud-init accomplishes two things:
  1. Getting the credentials (identity parameters) needed to initialize a RightScale Server via user-data.
  2. Optionally installing and running RightLink at boot time if its not already installed.

The user-data that drives cloud-init is generated by the RightScale platform based on tags on the MultiCloudImage (MCI) and/or the Server/ServerArray.  This generated user-data works for most flavors of Linux.

### Launching a Server with a Stock Image

Typically only the `rs_agent:type` and `rs_agent:mime_include_url` tags are used in order to bootstrap RightLink. To do this, the image must contain a suitable cloud-init that [supports user-data retrieval from the cloud](rl10_os_compatibility.html). The MultiCloudImage (MCI) must be tagged with `rs_agent:type=right_link_lite`. The MCI should be tagged with a suitable rightlink.boot.sh script, such as `rs_agent:mime_include_url=https://rightlink.rightscale.com/rll/10.5.2/rightlink.boot.sh`. As a convenience, more generic versions such as "10" or "10.5" may be specified as a way to install the latest GA version for a lineage. To use, add tag `rs_agent:mime_include_url=https://rightlink.rightscale.com/rll/10/rightlink.boot.sh`. See the [releases](/rl10/releases) page for full list of supported versions to install and release notes.

It it recommended to use the "RightLink 10.x.x Linux Base" ServerTemplate available from the Marketplace as a starting point. See the [releases](/rl10/releases/) page for links.

The simplest way to use your own images is to [install cloud-init](rl10_cloud_init_installation.html) on them.

## Advanced Usage

### Supported tags

The RightScale platform supports the following tags.

Tag | Purpose |
--- | ------- |
`rs_agent:type=right_link_lite` | **Required:** tells the platform the type of agent for the purpose of inferring its capabilities. This tag causes the values emitted in the user-data to be tailored to the agent type |
`rs_agent:mime_include_url=<url>` | **Optional**: downloads and execute the contents of the URL using `x-include-url`. This is the mechanism used to accomplish (2) above and install RightLink at boot time. This tag is NOT compatible with the `rs_agent:http_proxy` tag.<br> **default**: none |
`rs_agent:mime_shellscript=<url>`<br>`rs_agent:hashbang_shellscript=<url>` | **Optional**: simulates `x-include-url` with a simple canned shell script. This better supports older/alternate versions of cloud-init and is also compatible with the `rs_agent:http_proxy` tag.<br> **default**: none |
<code>rs_agent:userdata=(query&#124;mime&#124;liquid)</code> | **Optional**: determines the format of the user-data being produced by the platform<br><ul><li>*query*: URL-encoded querystring of key/value pairs</li><li>*mime*: multipart MIME document</li><li>*liquid*: arbitrary; user_data field of MCI/server is rendered as a Liquid template</li></ul>**default**: mime if agent type is `right_link_lite`, query otherwise |
<code>rs_agent:mime_identity=(shellscript&#124;write_file)</code> | **Optional**: determines how RightLink agent identity parameters are placed on the instance<br><ul><li>*shellscript*: x-shellscript MIME part **(default)**</li><li>*write_file*: cloud-config MIME part containing write_files action</li></ul> |
`rs_agent:mime_identity_path=<filepath>`<br>`rs_agent:hashbang_identity_path=<filepath>` | **Optional**: determines where the agent identity parameters are placed<br>**default**: `/var/lib/rightscale-identity` |




### User-Provided User-data

In addition to the generated user-data, The MCI or Server can have user-data and it will be added to the user-data for the instance as follows:

if rs_agent:userdata=query

* an ampersand ('&') is appended to the RightScale produced user-data and the user-provided string is appended to that

if rs_agent:userdata=mime

* if the value starts with `#!` then a `text/x-shellscript` part is produced
* if the value starts with http then a `text/x-include-url` part is produced
* else the value is placed as-is in a `text/plain` mime part and should start with a `#` directive for cloud-init to process it properly

if rs_agent:userdata=liquid

* the user-data is processed as a [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) template

### Liquid User-data

When `rs_agent:userdata=liquid` is specified on the MCI or server, the platform makes no attempt to format the user-data; instead, it treats the MCI's or incarnator's "user data" as a Liquid template. The core renders this template, providing an `rs_agent` object with RightLink / RightLink 10 parameters as its properties.

The properties available on the `rs_agent` object depend on whether the MCI is marked as RightLink or RightLink 10; the properties are named consistently with the key names that would normally be injected as query-string or MIME user-data (e.g. `RS_rn_id` is one property name if `rs_agent:type=right_link` and `client_id` is one property if `rs_agent:type=right_link_lite`). It is assumed that Liquid rendering will only be used for RightLink 10 agents and only those values are documented here.

To use a liquid template with a Server, edit the Server and paste the liquid template into the User Data field in "Server Details" -> "Advanced Options". To use a liquid template with an MCI, paste the liquid template into the User Data field for the image in the "Clouds" tab for the MCI. Note each cloud/image will have to be edited individually.

#### Sample Template

The following example generates a cloud-config document for a CoreOS system. It contains a `write_files` section that writes the instance tokens to the identity file. It uses a for-loop to iterate blindly over the rs_agent variables, making it future-proof if new agent parameters are added. It also has the nice property that conditionally-present variables such as auto_launch and http_proxy do not require a Liquid conditional. If an http_proxy is set via the tag rs_agent:http_proxy it will use it, otherwise the environment variable will be empty and ignored.
