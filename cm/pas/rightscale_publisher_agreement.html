<li>PUBLICATION PROCESS<br>

Before Your Application can be submitted to the RightScale Component Library, You are responsible for evaluating and testing Your Component as to its technology, functionality, performance, and security.

4.3 Component ID. When Your Component is listed on the RightScale Component Library, We will provide You a unique Component ID, which will be assigned to and may be used only by You and only in connection with that particular Component.<br>
